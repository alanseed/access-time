Tool to display the Australian local times and UTC 

## Introduction  
The is a colourful range of [time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Australia) in Australia, my favourite being the zone for the 53 residents of Eucla. This variety of time zones becomes difficult for weather forecasters to manage since the numerical weather predictions all use UTC for their valid times.  

The list is for each hour starting at 00:00:00 local time and covers the next 7 days, which is the limit for the lead time of weather forecasts. 

This website uses the official list of Australian time zones as recognised by IANA and the javascript library luxon 2.0.2 to manage the transitions to daylight saving etc.
